# 3D-Multiplayer-RPG-Framework
Beautiful 3D low-poly RPG world setup with multiplayer networking capabilities, in separate modules. Features:
- Login system with credentials locally encrypted with AES
- Fast network communication between clients and server with RSA encryption
- Communication of movement, optimized through minimizing message frequency
- Fully functioning 3D character controller, with appropriate physics collisions
- Lots and lots and lots of low-poly modelling and line art

In this repository you'll also find a previous 2D version, before a 3D alternative was tackled.

Worked on from September 2020 to June 2021.
